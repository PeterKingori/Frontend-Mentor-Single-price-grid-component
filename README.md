## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to position items using CSS Flexbox and to center the whole component horizontally and vertically. I also learned how to use CSS media queries to change the layout for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

- Get better at using media queries
- Creating the layout using a mobile-first approach

### Useful resources

- [CSS Vertical Align](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-vertical-align-how-to-center-a-div-text-or-an-image-example-code/) - This helped me center the whole container vertically and horizontally in the body.
